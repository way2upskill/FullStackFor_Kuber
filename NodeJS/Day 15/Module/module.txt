Self-contained code unit:
1-Each file in Node.js treated as seperate module.
2-Variables,functions,or objects defined in one file are not accessible in another file by default unless you explicitly export them.

Encapsulation:
1-Node.js uses the CommonJS module system(module.exports and require)to ensure the code in one file does not pollute or interfere with the global scope.
2-This makes your code modular,maintainableand easier to debug.

What Exactly is a Module in NodeJS?
 A module in node.js represent a file containing a code that is self-contained, reusable and Encapsulated.
 Node.js uses the CommonJS module system.
 This module system came before ES Modules was introduced in JS; thats why sntax is different.
 Modules in Node.js are created by defining separate file for different functionalities.
 You must export anything you want to make accessible to other modules.

 Built in Modules in Node.js
 OS:Provides information about the operating system
 Path: Provides utility functions for working with the file paths
